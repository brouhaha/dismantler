INTRODUCTION

    Dismantler is an extensible disassembler with semiautomatic code
    recognition. The dismantler package provides disassembly support
    to Python programs, while the dismantle.py script allows binary
    files to be disassembled from the command line.

    Dismantler is primarily intended for disassembly of images of ROM
    data for the purpose of reverse-engineering. This is normally an
    iterative process in which the user repeatedly changes disassembly
    parameters while studying the results of each previous attempt, in
    order to infer the structure and functionality of the code under
    examination. Studying the hardware design of the target system may
    provide clues such as which interrupts are used, possible
    interrupt vectors, memory mapping, IO port functions, etc.
    
    Dismantler attempts to identify code, data, subroutines, etc.
    using a simple algorithm. Starting at one or more entry addresses
    (either user-specified or cpu-specific defaults), it disassembles
    the instruction at the specified location and then recursively
    continues disassembly at each possible computable next-instruction
    address. For most instructions, the next-instruction address will
    simply be the byte following the last operand byte of the current
    instruction. For a conditional jump, it may be either the
    following byte or the jump address. Each recursive thread of
    disassembly ends when the next instruction address cannot be
    computed without knowing the state of the processor registers,
    such as at a return or halt instruction.

    Automatic creation of labels for jumps, calls and data accesses
    provide hints to help the user find interesting locations such as
    subroutines, variables, etc. Highlighting of addresses which have
    not been classified points out possible dead code, or (more
    commonly) code that is reached by calculated addresses which the
    user will need to figure out by examining the disassembled code.
    When the disassembler detects that it is trying to treat the
    operand of an instruction as an opcode in another thread of
    disassembly, it highlights that situation in a comment to help the
    user detect probable disassembly errors that suggest incorrect
    entry addresses, an incorrect CPU selection, etc. The user can
    also manually specify breakpoints at which disassembly threads
    will end, specify addresses to be data, etc. in order to guide the
    disassembly process.

    While the currently-supported lsit of CPUs is small, dismantler is
    designed to be easily extensible to support new CPUs.

INSTALLATION

    Use the setup.py script to install dismantler. Here are some usage
    examples:

    Install in your user directory:
        ./setup.py install --user

    Install in the system default location:
        sudo ./setup.py install

    Install under /usr/local:
        sudo ./setup.py install --prefix /usr/local

    Create a source distribution:
        ./setup.py sdist

USAGE EXAMPLES

    dismantle.py --help

    dismantle.py --list_cpus
    
    dismantle.py -c 8085 -a rom.bin

    dismantle.py -c 8085 -a -e 0x0000 -e 0x0024 \
                 -l 0x0000 RST0 -l 0x0024 TRAP \
